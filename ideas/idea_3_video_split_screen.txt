make a standalone html where I can select 2 videos/images and i can see them side by side as if it is splitscreen video even after full screen. both videos are placing like split sreen which no gaps in between. I can choose files locally
both videos should play independely. can play in different time, volume.

I mean Build a web video/image player where the <video> element behaves exactly like a PowerPoint image/object:
- Click video → show 8 resize handles (4 corners + 4 side midpoints) like MS Office
- Drag any corner handle to freely resize (corners keep aspect ratio with Shift, otherwise stretch)
- Drag anywhere on video to move/position it freely on the page
- Show rotation handle (green circle on top) to rotate video
- Fully responsive, works on desktop and touch devices
Create a web video player using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no libraries) that behaves 100% like a PowerPoint video object:

- Click video → show 8 resize handles (corners + side midpoints) + green rotation handle on top
- Drag to move, resize (corners preserve aspect with Shift), rotate freely

additional features
- Add a small floating toolbar with these preset buttons:
  1. Fullscreen (100% width & height)
  2. Top Half (top 50% of screen)
  3. Bottom Half (bottom 50%)
  4. Left Half (left 50%)
  5. Right Half (right 50%)
  6. Quad (top-left quarter) – optional 5th preset
- When any preset button is clicked, instantly animate the video to that exact position and size (maximized vertically or horizontally as needed)
- Works on desktop + touch devices
- Keep it lightweight, no external libraries

should have
2 separate file upload option.
can be able to close and replace any video/image files anytime.

##############################################

Build a modern single-page web app (vanilla HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript, no frameworks) that does the following:

Core features (must behave exactly like PowerPoint / Microsoft Office objects):

1. Import images or videos  
   - Drag-and-drop or click a button to add <img> or <video> files (local files, multiple allowed).

2. Each imported media becomes a fully interactive object with:
   - Click to select → blue border + exactly 8 resize handles (4 corners + 4 mid-sides)
   - Drag any corner handle → resize (hold Shift = keep aspect ratio, no Shift = free stretch)
   - Drag side handles → resize only horizontally or vertically
   - Drag anywhere inside the object (not on handles) → move freely on the page
   - Green rotation handle on top → drag to rotate freely (hold Shift = 15° steps)
   - Full touch support (mobile/tablet): pinch to zoom/rotate, one-finger drag to move, etc.
   - Selected object is brought to front (z-index)

3. Snap Layouts (exactly like Windows 11)  
   - Hover over a small “maximize-like” button (top-right of selected object) → show Windows 11-style snap layout flyout (2 columns, 3 columns, 4 quadrants, etc.)
   - Clicking a layout instantly snaps the current object + suggests other objects to fill remaining zones (like Windows 11 Snap Assist)
   - Support for 2, 3, and 4-zone layouts

4. Additional requirements:
   - Objects stay inside viewport (no dragging off-screen)
   - Delete selected object with Delete or Backspace key
   - Deselect when clicking empty area
   - Responsive design, works perfectly on desktop and touch devices
   - No external libraries except optional lightweight ones (e.g. interact.js if it saves a lot of code)
   - Clean, modern look with subtle shadows and smooth animations
   - Export current canvas as PNG (button)

Provide complete, well-commented, ready-to-run HTML file (one single file preferred).
