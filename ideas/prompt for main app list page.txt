Create a SINGLE, FULLY STANDALONE HTML file (one .html file only, no external CSS, JS, fonts, or libraries) that serves as the MAIN HOMEPAGE for my offline local webapp collection. Think of it like a personal Windows 8 / Metro start screen. Follow all instructions strictly and optimize for lightweight performance and clean code.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. The file must work fully offline. It must not load or reference any external URLs, fonts, CDNs, or resources.


2. Use ONLY:



pure HTML5

pure CSS (embedded <style>)

pure vanilla JavaScript (embedded <script>)


3. DESIGN STYLE:



Windows 8 / Metro UI Live Tiles

Grid of 100 tiles

Different tile sizes (1x1 small, 2x1 medium, 2x2 wide, 4x2 large)

Bright Metro-style accent colors: blue, teal, purple, red, green, orange, yellow, pink

Each tile contains:

A lightweight SVG icon (inline SVG only)

A text label under the icon


On click, the tile must open the linked standalone HTML page in a new tab


4. FIRST 5 TILES (must appear at top left, in this order):



“AI Chatbot” → link: webpages/Al-chatbot.html

“File Explorer” → link: webpages/file_explorer.html

“Media Gallery” → link: webpages/media_gallery.html

“Portfolio Dashboard” → link: webpages/portfolio_dashboard.html

“Split-Screen Tool” → link: webpages/split_screen_2_image_only_v2.html


5. REMAINING 95 TILES:



Use random common app names like Calculator, Music Player, Notes, Tasks, Recorder, Stopwatch, Weather, Clock, Wallet, etc.

Use alphabetical or random ordering, your choice.

Link them to webpages/app1.html … webpages/app95.html

No duplicate icons; reuse simple SVG shapes when needed.


6. LAYOUT:



Use CSS Grid

Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, laptop)

Smooth scrolling

Tile spacing similar to Windows 8 start screen

Tile hover animation using transform: scale(1.05) and subtle shadow

No heavy animations


7. HEADER:



At the top, centered: a large elegant digital clock showing HH:MM:SS and full date

Update every second using JS

Do not use any external clock packages


8. BACKGROUND:



Make a very lightweight animated background: Option A: soft gradient wave animation using CSS keyframes OR Option B: ultra-light JS particle dots (under 60 lines JS)

Must not exceed 150 KB total file size


9. PERFORMANCE RULES:



No external libraries at all

No frameworks

No image files; only CSS or inline SVG

Total HTML file size must remain under 150 KB

Code must be clean, readable, and modular


10. EXTRAS:



Add a tiny localStorage-based setting:

Toggle: Light Mode / Dark Mode

Save user preference and apply on next load


Provide a small search bar at the top to filter tiles by name
